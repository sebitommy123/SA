Some features missing:
 1. Aliasing. a SAP should be able to expose an alias, which gets converted to some other text.
    E.g. cs -> control_spot
 2. Better syntax errors
 3. Grafana link


UI
The UI will be an alternative to the shell, but will still rely heavily on the query system, since the query system is a fundamental part of the data itself. The data contains links, themselves expressed as queries.
